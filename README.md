Customer Churn Prediction — Deep Learning Project
1) Overview:

This project is to predict customer churn for a bank using a deep learning classification model. The goal was to build a beginner-friendly yet complete workflow to understand how Keras and TensorFlow operate when constructing, training, and improving neural networks.
I used the Kaggle interface, its inbuilt Keras interface along with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization. This project helped me learn how different layers work, how model performance changes with tuning, and how evaluation metrics behave.

3) What I Did:

--> Built Two Versions of the Model

A) Basic Version:

Implemented the core components of a neural network
Understood how layers, activation functions, and compilation work
Performed basic training on the dataset

B) Improved Version:

Added accuracy score evaluation
Introduced validation split
Adjusted classification threshold
Tuned number of epochs
Added visualization

3) Tech Stack

Python
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
TensorFlow / Keras
Google colab notebook environment 
kaggle inbuilt interface (inbuilt keras library)

4) Key Learnings

How deep learning layers are structured in Keras
How training, validation, and evaluation work
How model tuning affects accuracy and loss
How to experiment with thresholding in classification problems
Hands-on understanding of the end-to-end deep learning workflow
